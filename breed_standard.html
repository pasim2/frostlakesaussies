            <p><span class="boldandunderline">BRIEF HISTORICAL SUMMARY:</span> While there are many
                theories as to the origin of the Australian Shepherd, the breed as we
                know it today developed exclusively in the United States. The
                Australian Shepherd was given its name because of the association
                with Basque Sheepherders who came to the United States from
                Australia in the 1800’s.
                <br />
                The Australian Shepherd’s popularity rose steadily with the boom of
                western horseback riding after World War II, which became known
                to the general public via rodeos, horse shows, movies, and television
                shows. Their inherent versatile and trainable personality made them
                assets to American farms and ranches. The American stockman
                continued the development of the breed, maintaining its versatility,
                keen intelligence, strong herding instincts, and eye-catching
                appearance that originally won their admiration.
                <br />
                Although each individual is unique in colour and markings, all
                Australian Shepherds show an unsurpassed devotion to their
                families. Their many attributes have guaranteed the Australian
                Shepherd’s continued popularity.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">GENERAL APPEARANCE:</span> The Australian Shepherd
                is well balanced, slightly longer than tall, of medium size and bone, with
                colouring that offers variety and individuality. He is attentive and animated,
                lithe and agile, solid and muscular without cloddiness. He has a coat of moderate
                length and coarseness. He has a docked or natural tail.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">IMPORTANT PROPORTIONS:</span> Measuring from the breastbone
                to rear of thigh and from top of the withers to the ground the Australian Shepherd is slightly
                longer than tall. Solidly built with moderate bone. Structure in the male reflects
                masculinity without coarseness. Bitches appear feminine without being slight of bone.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">BEHAVIOUR/TEMPERAMANT:</span> The Australian Shepherd is an
                intelligent working dog of strong herding and guarding instincts. He is a loyal companion
                and has the stamina to work all day. With an even disposition, he is good natured,
                seldom quarrelsome. He may be somewhat reserved in initial meetings.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">HEAD:</span> The head is clean cut, strong and dry.
                Overall size should be in proportion to the body.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span class=underline> CRANIAL REGION:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Skull:</span> Top flat to slightly domed. It may show a
                slight occipital protuberance. Length and width are equal.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Stop:</span> Moderate, well-defined.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span class=underline> FACIAL REGION:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Nose:</span> Blue merles and blacks have black pigmentation on the nose
                (and lips). Red merles and reds have liver (brown) pigmentation on
                the nose (and lips). On the merles it is permissible to have small pink
                spots; however, they should not exceed 25 % of the nose on dogs
                over one year of age, which is a serious fault.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Muzzle:</span> Equal in length or slightly shorter than the back skull.
                Viewed from the side the topline of the back skull and muzzle form
                parallel planes, divided by a moderate, well-defined stop. The
                muzzle tapers little from base to nose and is rounded at the tip.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Jaws/Teeth:</span> A full complement of strong white teeth should meet in
                a scissors bite or may meet in a pincer bite..
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">EYES:</span> Brown, blue, amber or any variation or combination thereof,
                including flecks and marbling. Almond shaped, not protruding nor sunken. The blue merles and blacks
                have black pigmentation on eye rims. The red merles and reds have liver (brown) pigmentation on
                eye rims. Expression: Showing attentiveness and intelligence, alert and eager. Gaze should be keen
                but friendly.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">EARS:</span> Triangular, of moderate size and leather, set high on the
                head. At full attention they break forward and over, or to the side as a
                rose ear
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">NECK:</span> Strong, of moderate length, slightly arched at the crest,
                fitting well into the shoulders.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">BODY:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Top line:</span> Back straight and strong, level and firm from withers to hip
                joints.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Croup:</span> Moderately sloping.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Chest:</span> Not broad, but deep with the lowest point reaching the elbow.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Ribs:</span> Well sprung and long, neither barrel chested nor slab-sided.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Underline and belly:</span> Shows a moderate tuck-up.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">TAIL:</span> Straight, naturally long or naturally short. When docked (in
                countries where this practice is not forbidden), or naturally short, not

                <span class=underline> FOREQUARTERS:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Shoulder:</span> Shoulder-blades long, flat, fairly close set at the withers
                and well laid back. The upper arm, which should be relatively the same length as the shoulder-blade,
                attaches at an approximate right angle to the shoulder line with forelegs dropping straight,
                perpendicular to the ground.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Legs:</span> Straight and strong. Bone strong, oval rather than round.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Metacarpus (Pastern):</span> Medium length and very slightly sloping.
                Front dewclaws may be removed.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Forefeet:</span> Oval, compact, with close-knit, well-arched toes. Pads
                thick and resilient.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span class=underline> HINDQUARTERS:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> General appearance:</span> The width of the hindquarters is equal to the
                width of the forequarters at the shoulders. The angulation of the pelvis and upper thigh corresponds
                to the angulation of the shoulder-blade and upper arm, forming an approximate right angle.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Stifle:</span> Clearly defined.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Hock joints:</span> Moderately bent.
                Front dewclaws may be removed.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Hocks:</span> Short, perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other
                when viewed from the rear. <span class="bold">No</span> rear dewclaws.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Hind feet:</span> Oval, compact with close-knit, well-arched toes. Pads
                thick and resilient.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline">GAIT:</span> The Australian Shepherd has a smooth, free and easy gait. He
                exhibits great agility of movement with a well-balanced, ground covering stride. Fore-and hind legs move
                straight and parallel with the centre line of the body. As speed increases, the feet (front and
                rear) converge toward the centre line of gravity of the dog while the back remains firm and level.
                The Australian Shepherd must be agile and able to change direction or alter gait instantly.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline"> COAT:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Hair:</span> Of medium texture, straight to wavy, weather resistant and of
                medium length. The undercoat varies in quantity with variations in climate. Hair is short and smooth
                on the head, ears, front of forelegs and below the hocks. Backs of forelegs and breeches are moderately
                feathered. There is a moderate mane and frill, more pronounced in dogs than in bitches.
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Colour:</span> Blue merle, black, red merle, red – all with or without white
                markings and/or tan markings, with no order of preference.
                <br />
                The hairline of a white collar does not exceed the point of the withers at the skin.
                <br />
                White is acceptable on the neck (either in part or as a full collar),
                chest, legs, muzzle underparts, blaze on head and white extension from underpart up to four inches (10
                cm),
                measuring from a horizontal line at the elbow.
                <br />
                White on the head should not predominate, and the eyes must be
                fully surrounded by colour and pigment. Merles characteristically become darker with increasing age.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline"> SIZE:</span>
                <br />
                <span class=underline> Height at the withers:</span> The preferred height for males is 20-23 inches
                (51-58 cm), females 18-21 inches (46-53 cm). Quality is not to be sacrificed in favour of size.
            </p>
            <p><span class="boldandunderline"> FAULTS:</span> Any departure from the foregoing points should be
                considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be in exact
                proportion to its degree and <span class="bold">its effect upon the health and welfare of the
                    dog.</span>
            </p>
            <span class="boldandunderline">SEVERE FAULTS:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Prick ears and hanging ears.</li>
                <li>Non-typical coats.</li>
